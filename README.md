# ☕ Java Codes and Projects

Welcome to my Java repository — a complete collection of Java programs, DSA solutions, and mini projects that reflect my journey of learning, practicing, and applying Java programming.

Here, I explore everything from core syntax and object-oriented programming to algorithmic problem solving and real-world mini applications.
